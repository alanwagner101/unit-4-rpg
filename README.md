This game was a test in how to use jQuery to alter events on the DOM. Specifically making an RPG in which a selected character faces off with a selected enemy and keeping track of hit points and damage points for both.

The way it is set up is you first select a hero.
once selected you have an option of selected the enemy you would like to take on.
once both are selected you enter an attack mode in which you can see both the hit points of the hero and the hit points of the enemy.
on selecting attack you will see the damage taken from both the hero and the enemy.
when an enemy is defeated you are given a chance to select a new enemy and the process starts over.

When all of the enemies are defeated it displays that you have won and allows you to click the restart button to start again and pick a new hero.

If you are defeated before all the enemies are defeated it displays that you have lost and gives you a chance to hit the restart button and try it again.

This was a fun challenge that required a lot of new research on ways to affect multiply objects on screen with a single button click and to keep track of all of the data behind the scenese in order to move on to new enemies without losing track of where your score was before.

I hope you enjoy the game!
